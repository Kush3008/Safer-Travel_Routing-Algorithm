# Safer-Travel_Routing-Algorithm

Safer Travel is a Python and machine learning (ML)-based project that aims to find the safest path between two points by leveraging crime data obtained through web scraping using BeautifulSoup. This project was developed as part of the techno hackathon organized by Ja Assure.

Safer Travel utilizes the power of Python and ML to collect and analyze crime data from various sources using web scraping techniques. It uses BeautifulSoup, a popular Python library for web scraping, to extract relevant crime data such as crime types, locations, and timestamps from online sources. The collected data is then processed and analyzed to create a crime risk score for different areas.

Using the crime risk score, Safer Travel implements an ML algorithm that finds the safest path between two points on a map. The algorithm takes into consideration the crime risk scores of different areas along the potential paths and recommends the path with the lowest crime risk score, thus ensuring that users can choose the safest route for their intended destination.

Safer Travel not only provides users with a reliable and efficient way to find the safest path between two points, but it also helps raise awareness about crime rates in different areas and promotes safer navigation in urban environments.

Key Features:

- Web scraping using BeautifulSoup to collect crime data from online sources
- ML algorithm to analyze crime data and calculate crime risk scores for different areas
- Safest path finder that recommends the path with the lowest crime risk score
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction and navigation
- Promotes safer navigation and raises awareness about crime rates in different areas

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Beautiful Soup for web scraping
- ML libraries for data analysis and model building

Special Features:

- Alert button!
- Crime statistics map
- Safe path finder

## Install
- Need to add your own google maps api key.
- Need to install libraries: Pandas, gmplot, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn (and any other missing libraries).
