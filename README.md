# Safer-Travel_Routing-Algorithm
Python &amp; ML Safest Path Finder using Crime Data

Project Title: Safer Travel - Python and ML-based Safest Path Finder

Description:
D is a Python and Machine Learning (ML) based project that aims to find the safest path between two points by leveraging crime dataset obtained through web scraping using BeautifulSoup. This project is developed as part of the techno hackathon organized by Ja Assure.

Safer Travel utilizes the power of Python and ML to collect and analyze crime data from various sources using web scraping techniques. The project uses BeautifulSoup, a popular Python library for web scraping, to extract relevant crime data such as crime types, locations, and timestamps from online sources. The collected data is then processed and analyzed to create a crime risk score for different areas.

Using the crime risk score, Safer Travel implements a ML algorithm that finds the safest path between two points on a map. The algorithm takes into consideration the crime risk scores of different areas along the potential paths and recommends the path with the lowest crime risk score, thus ensuring that users can choose the safest route for their intended destination.

Safer Travel not only provides users with a reliable and efficient way to find the safest path between two points, but it also helps raise awareness about crime rates in different areas and promotes safer navigation in urban environments.
